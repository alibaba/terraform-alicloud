# Alicloud terraform provider Website

This is a [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) project, which builds a static
site of alicloud terraform provider source.

## Contributions Welcome!

If you find a typo or you feel like you can improve the HTML, CSS, or
JavaScript, we welcome contributions. Feel free to open issues or pull
requests like any normal GitHub project, and we'll merge it in.

## Running the Site Locally

To run the site locally(mac for example), install ruby and middleman:

```shell
$ brew install ruby
$ gem install middleman
```

Then clone this repository and cd into terraform-provider-docs folder.

At last, you can manually run the website like this:

```shell
$ bundle
$ bundle exec middleman
```

Then open up `http://localhost:4567`.
